# My First React Learning Project

## Information about this learning project

In this project I used static array of objects that contains a Book cover image, Title and Author name. Then I made another
Component that is where I passed the list of objects and map through the objects. Then extract the items and show in
image and heading tags.

This is a very basic project while learning react where I learned how components work and How to add event listeners. I also
learned how to map/iterate through data and show it in HTML tags.
